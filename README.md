# Decorator-Pattern--Pizza
Let us consider a PIZZA class which has a method that displays the message “Pizza”. A PIZZA object may be
decorated by 3 kinds of toppings.
 OLIVE class has a method that displays the message “With Olive”.
 PEPPER class has a method that displays the message “With Pepper”.
 MASHROOM class has a method that displays the message “With Mashroom”.
We would like to use the decorator pattern to create pizzas with toppings.
